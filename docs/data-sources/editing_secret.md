# sitecore_editing_secret (Data Source)

Use this data source to get the editing secret for a Sitecore environment. The editing secret is used for authentication when making API calls to the Sitecore environment.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# First, get or create a project
data "sitecore_project" "main" {
  name = "My Project"
}

# Get an existing environment
data "sitecore_environment" "main" {
  project_id = data.sitecore_project.main.id
  name       = "production"
}

# Get the editing secret for the environment
data "sitecore_editing_secret" "main" {
  environment_id = data.sitecore_environment.main.id
}

# Output the secret (marked as sensitive)
output "editing_secret" {
  value     = data.sitecore_editing_secret.main.secret
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `environment_id` - (Required) The ID of the environment to get the editing secret for.

## Attribute Reference

* `secret` - (Read-only) The editing secret for the environment. This should be treated as sensitive data.

## Notes

* The editing secret is sensitive and should not be logged or stored in plain text
* Always mark outputs containing the secret as `sensitive = true`
* The secret can be used for authentication with the Sitecore environment API
* If you need to rotate the secret, you may need to recreate the environment

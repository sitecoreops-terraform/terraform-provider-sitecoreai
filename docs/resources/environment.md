## Example Usage

```hcl
# First, get or create a project
data "sitecore_project" "main" {
  name = "My Project"
}

# Create a new environment
resource "sitecore_environment" "staging" {
  project_id   = data.sitecore_project.main.id
  name         = "staging"
  tenant_type  = "Shared"
  is_prod      = false
}

# Output the environment details
output "environment_id" {
  value = sitecore_environment.staging.id
}

output "environment_host" {
  value = sitecore_environment.staging.host
}
```

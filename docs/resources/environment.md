# sitecoreai_environment (Resource)

Manages a traditional SitecoreAI combined environment with both authoring and editing.

-> This manages a traditional combined environment with both cm and editing host(s).
-> Please note that from SitecoreAI Deploy API v2, there can be separated environments for content management and editing hosts. If you are using that feature in SitecoreAI, you should use the resources [cm_environment](./cm_environment.md) and [eh_environment](./eh_environment.md).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# First, create a project (or use an existing one)
resource "sitecoreai_project" "example" {
  name        = "XMC"
  description = "Project for environment example"
}

# Create a new environment within the project
resource "sitecoreai_environment" "staging" {
  name       = "staging"
  project_id = sitecoreai_project.example.id
  is_prod    = false
}

# Output the environment details
output "environment_id" {
  value       = sitecoreai_environment.staging.id
  description = "The ID of the created environment"
}

output "environment_host" {
  value       = sitecoreai_environment.staging.host
  description = "The host URL of the environment"
}

output "environment_status" {
  value       = sitecoreai_environment.staging.is_deleted ? "deleted" : "active"
  description = "The status of the environment"
}
```

# Terraform provider for SitecoreAI

This is terraform provider to enable usage and configuration of SitecoreAI resources in Terraform or OpenTofu.

The main focus is on establishing projects and environments by using the SitecoreAI Deploy API:
* [SitecoreAI Deploy API: Swagger UI](https://xmclouddeploy-api.sitecorecloud.io/)
* [SitecoreAI Deploy API: OpenAPI Specification](https://xmclouddeploy-api.sitecorecloud.io/swagger/v1/swagger.json)

To use the api you will need credentials, see [how to create Organization automation client in SitecoreAI](https://doc.sitecore.com/sai/en/developers/sitecoreai/manage-client-credentials-for-a-sitecoreai-organization-or-environment.html#create-an-automation-client-for-a-sitecoreai-organization)

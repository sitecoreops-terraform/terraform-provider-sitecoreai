# Terraform provider for SitecoreAI

This is terraform provider to enable usage and configuration of SitecoreAI resources in Terraform or OpenTofu.

See the provider in [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/sitecoreops-terraform/sitecoreai/latest/docs)

The main focus is on establishing projects and environments by using the SitecoreAI Deploy API:
* [SitecoreAI Deploy API: Swagger UI](https://xmclouddeploy-api.sitecorecloud.io/swagger)

To use the api you will need credentials, you can use the Sitecore CLI or an automation client. See [how to create Organization automation client in SitecoreAI](https://doc.sitecore.com/sai/en/developers/sitecoreai/manage-client-credentials-for-a-sitecoreai-organization-or-environment.html#create-an-automation-client-for-a-sitecoreai-organization)

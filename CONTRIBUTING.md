# SitecoreAI Terraform provider

The project is a Terraform provider built using
* Go
* Terraform Plugin Framework

The folder structure:
* `pkg/apiclient/` which is a client to interact with the SitecoreAI Deploy API, see [SitecoreAI Deploy API v1: OpenAPI Specification](https://xmclouddeploy-api.sitecorecloud.io/swagger/v1/swagger.json) and [SitecoreAI Deploy API v2: OpenAPI Specification](https://xmclouddeploy-api.sitecorecloud.io/swagger/v2/swagger.json)
* `pkg/provider/` which is the Terraform provider that exposes resources and datasources and uses the apiclient to call the api.
* `examples/` with several terraform examples to show how the provider can be used in terraform modules.
* `docs/` contains the provider documentation for the Terraform registry. Everything here is automatically generated and should not be edited manually.

## Initial setup

```bash
go install -v ./...
```

## Linting

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

## Formatting

```bash
gofmt -s -w -e .
```

## Building

```bash
go build
```

## Testing api client

To run the test, those are integration tests and will make actual calls to the SitecoreAI Deploy API:

```bash
# Set your Sitecore credentials as environment variables
export SITECOREAI_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export SITECOREAI_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Run a specific test, here client authentication
go test ./pkg/apiclient/... -v -run TestClientAuthentication

# Run all tests
go test ./pkg/apiclient/... -v
```

## Testing terraform provider

```sh
# Run a specific test, here client authentication
go test ./pkg/provider/... -v -run TestProviderMetadata

# Run all tests
go test ./pkg/provider/... -v
```

## Documentation

Documentation in `docs/` folder is for the public Terraform registry, see documentation at [Documenting terraform providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/docs)

Documentation is generated by using `tfplugindocs` see [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs)

### Examples for resources and data sources

To create examples that will be included in the generated documentation pages, the examples should be created at the right paths. See [Examples readme](./examples/README.md)

### Generating Documentation

The documentation in `/docs` is generated using the `tfplugindocs` tool:

```bash
cd tools
go generate
```

This will update the documentation files in the `docs/` directory based on the provider's Go code and the structured examples.

## Using Sitecore CLI authentication

Sitecore CLI is a command line. The provider can re-use authentication from the CLI. To enabl

* [dotnet 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (as it is requirement for Sitecore CLI)
* [Sitecore CLI](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/latest/developer-tools/install-sitecore-command-line-interface.html) by running:
    ```bash
    dotnet nuget add source -n Sitecore https://nuget.sitecore.com/resources/v3/index.json
    dotnet tool install Sitecore.CLI
    ```
* Initialize Sitecore CLI with SitecoreAI plugin:
    ```bash
    dotnet sitecore init
    dotnet sitecore plugin add -n Sitecore.DevEx.Extensibility.XMCloud
    ```
* Authenticate by running
    ```bash
    dotnet sitecore cloud login
    ```
* Define to use Sitecore CLI authentication
    ```bash
    export SITECOREAI_USE_CLI=1
    ```

## Diagnostics

The communication can be captured by specifying a proxy server eg. Burp

```bash
# When running in devcontainers and proxy server on host
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://host.docker.internal:8081"

# When running both project and proxy server on host
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://localhost:8081"
```

It is necessary to trust the certificate, eg. Burp can export the certificate in DER format.

```bash
# Convert DER public certificate to .pem format
openssl x509 -inform der -in burp.der -out burp.pem

# Set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE to trust the certificate(s)
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="$(pwd)/burp.pem"
```
